#CSCI_1300 Final Project

##Project Intro
In this project, you’ll design a two-player text-based game involving DNA sequencing of 
lion conservation genomics. Players act as young genomic scientists competing to become the 
next Lead Genomicist on a high-impact conservation team. The project emphasizes design, 
creativity, genetic reasoning, and software engineering. Along the way, the players will make 
strategic decisions, face unexpected challenges, and collect Discover Points as they grow and 
refine other traits, such as accuracy, efficiency, and insight. Whether navigating new samples or 
working alongside co-workers, each choice will shape their journey. The player who earns the 
most Discover Points by demonstrating they have what it takes to be the future scientist of DNA 
sequencing with conservation animals will be chosen as the next Lead Genomicist! 
This project has no answer key, prebuilt test cases, or set questions. Instead, you’ll be 
given a list of requirements to meet, and it’s up to you to fulfill them in the most creative way 
possible. This is worth 10% of your final grade. 


##Game Play
The goal of the game is simple: as a player, you’ll lead your scientist on one of two 
distinct paths. Each path offers its own unique set of advantages and challenges, shaping your 
journey and influencing your growth along the way. As you advance, you’ll come across 
unexpected obstacles that may either help or hinder your progress. Navigate these challenges 
wisely to prove that you have what it takes to become the next Lead Genomicist. 


###Background info
This project was my final project in my CS class and also my first game project I have created, all about
learning and solidyfing my knowledge in key C++ concepts.
Learned about various concepts including:
Reading a file
Class structures and OOP
User input and output (Terminal based game)
Formatting a game made in the terminal



To compile, run the three cpp files. After that enjoy the game!!
